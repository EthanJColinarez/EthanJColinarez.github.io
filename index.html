                <h2>Technological Developments and Mental Health</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has become such a major part in everyone's life in the modern era that nearly everything we do is connected to some form of technology.
                    Social media especially has become a focal point in the younger generations' lives that interacting with it has become second nature for us.
                    Everyone at this point is aware of how social media can affect one's mental health, and nearly everyone who regularly uses it has probably experienced this themselves.
                    While it's true that social media can have many negative effects on mental health, it isn't so much black and white as the effects that it can have all have their own upsides and downsides.

                <h2>Negatives of Technology, especially Social Media</h2>
                <p>
                    At this point, everyone's heard about the negatives of social media and excessive use or reliance on technology. This includes things such as unrealistic expectations, warped perceptions of reality, FOMO, etc.
                    However, there are legitimate health and psychological risks that can arise from constant exposure to social media. Compromised sleep patterns and reduced cognitive
                    ability has been reported among young children who tend to use social media often, with concerns of increased chances of depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc all being cited
                    to possibly affect future generations as the age minimum for social media exposure is lowered with every generation.

                <h2>Positives of Technology in the field of Mental Health</h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years, technological developments have grown at a miraculous rate. The past few decades have been home to a period of nearly unprecedented technological development, with many of these developments making their way into the field of mental health.
                    We've seen improvements on treatment methods with things such as robotics being used to assist mental health patients and identify risk factors, or algorithms designed to analyze behavior and alert patients or professionals of possible symptoms for mental illnesses.
                    Thanks to technology, mental health awareness is at an all time high due to the traffic of the internet and platforms such as Twitter or Instagram allowing users to discuss any topic they wish, with mental health and the stigma around it taking the forefront in recent years.
                    Even previous methods have been reexamined through the lens of these new technological developments by utilizing previous wearables and integrating them with new databases to more accurately store information and provide assistance to patients.

                <h2>Neutral Ground</h2>
                <p>
                    Again however, the integration of new technologies in the field of mental health is not a black or white topic. While there are both positives or negatives, it's impossible to say whether or not any of this is objectively good or bad.
                    There is a lot of neutral ground because the varying amount of technology allows it to cater to any multitude of needs for nearly anyone of all walks of life or circumstances. Allowing people to connect with others who share the same interests online has given way to infinite amounts of communities for whatever niche anyone can want.
                    While yes, internet or social media addiction exist, nearly anything in excess can create an addiction. Moderation is the key for technology and mental health to exist without having an adverse effect on each other.

                <p>
                    Technology will only continue to develop as the years go by and the discussion about mental health will, hopefully, grow along with it as more people become aware of the effects that it can have in excess.
                    So long as moderation becomes
